# About

Reads Pokemon stats from a file formatted for Pokemon Essentials v19 and displays the data on a webpage via a self hosted web server. The application runs in Docker, so you need to have Docker installed. Will save the data into a MySQL Database (stored locally in Docker, yeah im using your storage space what are you gonna do about it). Uses REST API made with NodeJS, Frontend uses AngularJS.

All of this is being done locally because:
- I do not want to pay for cloud
- I do not know how to handle security stuff for the API and Database
- I want to practice using Docker

## Installing Docker

- steps for windows, mac, linux

## File Format

- file format to come
