# About

Reads Pokemon stats from a file formatted for Pokemon Essentials v19 and displays the data on a webpage via a self hosted web server. The application runs in Docker, so you need to have Docker installed. Will save the data into a SQLite Database (stored locally in Docker, yeah im using your storage space what are you gonna do about it).

All of this is being done locally because:
- I do not want to pay for hosting
- I do not know how to handle security stuff for the API and Database
- I want to practice using Docker
- Are enough people really gonna use this to warrant hosting

Note that because it runs in Docker, you do not need to have NodeJS, SQLite, or any other dependencies installed, just Docker.
